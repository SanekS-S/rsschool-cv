My goal is to learn the basics of JavaScript for a more in-depth study of frontend and backend development.

I have deep knowledge of C++, basic knowledge of Java and JavaScript. Despite the fact that I have no work experience, I have been developing small applications for 2-3 years. Currently I am studying at BSUIR at the Faculty of FITU, specialty SUI. Also I have basic knowledge of English, and can understand some professional texts.
